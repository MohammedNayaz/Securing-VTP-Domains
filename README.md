# Securing-VTP-Domains
Cisco Internship

Objective
-The objective of this exercise is for you to learn and understand how to secure VTP domains using Cisco catalyst switches. By default, VTP domains are not password-protected

Purpose
-Securing the VTP is a fundamental skill. When VTP domains are not configured with a password, rough switches can be added to the network and disrupt service. As a Cisco engineer, as well as in the Cisco CCNA exam, you will be expected to know how to configure VTP password

Task 1: In preparation for VLAN configuration, configure a hostname on Sw1 and as depicted in the topology.

Task 2: Configure and verify sw1 as a VTP server switch and configure SW2 as a VTP client switch. Both switches should be in the VTP domain name CISCO. Secure VTP message with the VTP password CISCO.

Task 4: Configure and verify VLANs 10 and 20 on SW1 with the names provided above. Validate that these VLANs are still propagated to SW3 after VTP has been secured.

CONCLUSION:

The environment in an organization is totally different from what we experience in our colleges and classrooms. There, the people are busily working towards achieving the targets given to them. Even a small careless mistake may lead to loss for the company. So, the workers/employees must be efficient enough to make a bold move to finish the work within stipulated time to achieve the target.
I am glad to inform you that I got an internship at Cisco Networking Academy. I started my internship on 8th September 2021. I had worked with the team for an entire one month. I was glad to be a part of this team. I was supported by the whole team of Cisco Networking Academy As days passed there were so many presentation which had to presented to the whole team and we had meeting which were fixed and some developments of the resources which I had to do to improve the meeting register .At the end of the day I had to submit the report of the day work to the head of the department. And then come the weekends where we had off and fun activities.
